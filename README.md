## Technologies

- Vue
  - instead of React
- [Wing](http://usewing.ml/)?

## Must
- [ ] Timer for each pick
- [ ] When timer runs out: auto-pick highest ranked player, skip pick, pause until pick entered

## Nice
- [x] Enter picks with keyboard only
- [ ] Pre-draft ranking view
- [ ] Roster view
- [ ] Zoomed-out position view: see at a glance which positions have high-rated players left
- [ ] Autofill picks
- [ ] Transitions
- [ ] Bye-week view, so you can see when each of your players has a bye week
- [ ] Mark target players
- [ ] Work offline
- [ ] Variable league size
- [ ] Load player list from online
- [ ] Multi-user mode (SignalR)
